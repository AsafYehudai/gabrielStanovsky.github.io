# About me 
I do research in computational linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

I did my postdoc with [Prof. Luke Zettlemoyer]("https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz") at the University of Washington and with [Prof. Noah Smith]("https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/") at the
[Allen Institute for AI]("http://allenai.org"), my PhD at Bar-Ilan University's [NLP lab]("http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/"), with [Prof. Ido Dagan]("http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/"), and my MSc with [Prof. Michael Elhadad]("http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad"), at the Ben Gurion University.

I'm also a wannabe [movie buff]("https://letterboxd.com/gabistanovsky/films/diary/"), [concert goer]("http://www.setlist.fm/concerts/Gabis") and [book lover]("https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24306303-gabriel-stanovsky").
